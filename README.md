# Panolint

This was a small gem containing rules for linting code at Panorama Education and is now archived. This gem is now split into [panolint-ruby](https://github.com/panorama-ed/panolint-ruby) and [panolint-rails](https://github.com/panorama-ed/panolint-rails) which should be used in place of `panolint`.
